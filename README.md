A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science that consists of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root node.

Each node in a binary tree contains a value or some data and pointers or references to its left and right children (subtrees). If a child node is absent, its pointer/reference will be null, indicating that there is no child in that direction.

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science and programming for various applications, including representing hierarchical structures like file systems, representing arithmetic expressions for evaluation, implementing searching and sorting algorithms such as binary search trees, and more.
